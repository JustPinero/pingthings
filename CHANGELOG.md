# Changelog

## 1.6.1

Patch release — finishes the three v1.6.0 deferrals.

### Added

- **Auto-normalize on install** (`src/cli/install.js`). When ffmpeg is
  on PATH and `autoNormalize: true` (default), `pingthings install`
  spawns `pingthings normalize <pack>` on the freshly-installed pack
  via a child process so a normalize failure can never bring the
  install down. `--no-normalize` opt-out, `autoNormalize: false`
  config opt-out, graceful skip + one-line note when ffmpeg is
  missing.
- **Headphone-aware volume scaling**. New config field
  `headphoneVolumeScale` (default `1.0`). When the active audio
  output is detected as headphones-style and the scale is < 1.0,
  `play.js` multiplies effective volume by it. Detection result is
  cached in-process for 60s so the macOS `system_profiler` /
  Linux `pactl` / Windows `powershell` shell-out doesn't run on
  every play in a multi-pane dispatch burst.
  - `src/manifest-schema.js#effectiveVolume` now takes an optional
    third arg `outputScale`. Cap-then-scale order; backwards
    compatible with existing 2-arg callers.
  - `src/audio-output.js#detectAudioOutput()` accepts
    `{ ttlMs, force }` options for cache control. Test-only
    `_resetAudioOutputCache()` exported.

### Changed

- **Site catalog (`site/public/packs.json`) synced with manifest
  schema.** Every entry now includes `sourceUrl`, `tone`,
  `maxVolume` matching the canonical pack manifests. New test
  `test/site-catalog.test.js` enforces the catalog and filesystem
  stay in sync (no orphans either direction).

### Tests

- 176 → **187** (+11). Added: scaling tests in `manifest-schema`,
  cache tests in `audio-output`, and the new `site-catalog` suite.

## 1.6.0

Big release. Audio hygiene + metadata, user control, cross-platform
detection, on-demand HTTP server. 176 tests across 39 suites.

### Added — Audio hygiene & metadata

- **Manifest schema extensions** (`src/manifest-schema.js`):
  - `sourceUrl` — canonical URL to the pack's origin (download / project
    page). Backfilled across all 32 existing packs.
  - `maxVolume` — 0–100 cap on effective playback volume for this pack;
    player applies `min(globalVolume, maxVolume)`. Default 100. Defends
    against the class of issue that prompted mduel-retro's removal.
  - `tone` — one of `peaceful | professional | playful | aggressive |
    mixed`. Inferred from category for backfill.
  - `validatePackManifest()` for soft validation (returns
    `{ ok, errors }`); does not break legacy packs missing optional
    fields.
- **`pingthings normalize <pack>`** (`src/cli/normalize.js`) — runs
  ffmpeg's loudnorm filter (default -23 LUFS / -2 dB true peak) on
  every sound in a pack. Includes `--target-lufs`, `--peak-db`, and
  `--dry-run`. Exits cleanly with install instructions if ffmpeg
  isn't on PATH.

### Added — User control

- **`pingthings mute <duration>`** (`src/cli/mute.js`) — manual
  suppression of all playback for a fixed window. Accepts numeric
  minutes, or `s`/`m`/`h` suffixes (e.g. `30`, `90s`, `2h`).
  `pingthings mute off` cancels. `pingthings unmute` works as an
  alias. Sentinel file at `~/.config/pingthings/.muted-until`
  (Unix-ms expiration), respected by every `play` invocation.
- **Per-project pack override** — when a project has
  `.claude/settings.json` with `pingthings.activePack: "name"`,
  `pingthings play` invocations from that cwd use the project's
  pack instead of the global default. Layers with the new resolution
  priority: env (`PINGTHINGS_PACK`) > project override > schedule
  profile > global default.
- **Schedule profiles** — new `timeProfiles` config field. Map
  `{ "9-17": "office-minimal", "22-7": "serene-bells" }` rotates
  packs by hour-of-day. Wrap-around windows (overnight) supported.
- **Mute on call** — when `muteOnCall: true` in config, every play
  is suppressed if a known video-call client is detected as running
  (Zoom, Teams, Webex, BlueJeans, Skype). Process-allowlist
  detection in `src/call-detector.js`; cross-platform on macOS,
  Linux, Windows. Slack/Discord intentionally NOT in the allowlist
  to avoid false positives (their presence ≠ on-a-call).

### Added — Cross-platform detection libraries

- **`src/call-detector.js`** — `isOnCall()` returns true when a
  known video-call process is running. Uses `ps -A -o comm=` on
  macOS/Linux and `tasklist /FO CSV` on Windows.
  `getCallProcessAllowlist()` exposes the per-platform list for
  `pingthings doctor` and tests.
- **`src/audio-output.js`** — `detectAudioOutput()` returns
  `headphones | speakers | unknown`. macOS via `system_profiler`,
  Linux via `pactl info`, Windows via PowerShell + AudioDeviceCmdlets
  (or WMI fallback). Library available for future
  headphone-aware volume scaling.

### Added — Webhook server

- **`pingthings serve [--port N] [--host H] [--token T]`**
  (`src/cli/serve.js`) — on-demand HTTP server. Localhost-only
  default. Refuses to bind non-localhost without a `--token`.
  Endpoints:
  - `GET /healthz` → 200 OK with version info
  - `POST /play` → 202; spawns a random play
  - `POST /play/event/<event>` → 202; spawns a play for the named
    event (`done | permission | complete | error | blocked`)
  - Optional `X-Pingthings-Token` header authentication when
    `--token` is set
- Useful for CI alerts, GitHub Actions, deploy scripts, or any
  external trigger that should ring pingthings.

### Pack catalog

- `requests/phase-2-pack-expansion/2.1-source-30-packs.md` — request
  file scoping the addition of 30 new packs (5 each from Freesound,
  Mixkit, NASA, OpenGameArt, YouTube Audio Library, Internet
  Archive). Manifest templates, search queries, license expectations,
  and acceptance criteria documented; actual audio sourcing is a
  follow-up that needs browser access.

### Tests

- Baseline 130 → **176** (+46). New suites: `manifest-schema`,
  `config-extras` (mute + schedule + resolveActivePack),
  `call-detector`, `audio-output`, `serve`, `mute`.

## 1.5.0

### Added
- **Cross-process debounce** — new `debounceMs` config field (default
  `1500`) coalesces near-simultaneous `pingthings play` invocations
  into a single audible play. Solves the multi-pane Claude Code
  dispatch case where N sessions ending in lockstep would previously
  fire N overlapping sounds. Set `debounceMs: 0` to disable.
  Sentinel: `~/.config/pingthings/.last-play-time`.
- `pingthings config debounceMs <ms>` to tune the window.

### Removed
- **`mduel-retro` pack** removed from the registry, the website's
  `packs.json`, and the test suite. Some sounds in this pack had
  uncalibrated peaks that could damage speakers at default volume.
  Users who had it as their active pack will fall back to the default
  `7kaa-soldiers`. If you really want it back, install separately via
  `pingthings install <github-url>`.

### Notes
- `cooldown` (existing flag) and `debounceMs` (new) solve different
  problems and stack: `cooldown` prevents picking the same sound
  twice in a row, `debounceMs` prevents ANY sound from playing if
  one was played in the last N ms regardless of which.

## 1.1.0

### Added
- 3 new sound sections beyond retro gaming:
  - **Serene** (3 packs): temple bells, water drops, soft tones
  - **Office** (4 packs): minimal clicks, mechanical, digital pings, classic desk sounds

- 12 new sound packs (31 total, 522 sounds)
- Redesigned React site with 4 themed sections:
  - Landing page with section tiles
  - /retro — CRT scanlines, neon glow
  - /serene — soft gradients, zen aesthetic
  - /office — clean white/gray, minimal corporate
  - /nature — earthy greens, organic textures
- React Router for page navigation
- 20 sound categories
